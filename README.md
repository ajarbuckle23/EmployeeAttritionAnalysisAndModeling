# Employee Attrition Analysis and Logistic Regression Model 

## About the Dataset: 
In this project, I made use of a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists that contained employee attributes (such as department, performance rating, number of years with the company, etc.), employee survey responses (on topics such as work-life balance, job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, etc.), and whether or not the employee left the company.
